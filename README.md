# Bank Loan Report Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Bank Loan Report Project repository! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of our bank's lending activities, helping us monitor, assess, and optimize our loan portfolio. By utilizing various dashboards and visualizations, this project aims to deliver actionable insights into key loan metrics, loan performance, and overall portfolio health.

**_Disclaimer_** : _All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institutiion or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate capabilities of Microsoft Excel._

## Data Sources
**Financial Loan Data**: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "financial_loan.csv" file, containing detailed information about each loan issued by the company.

## Tools
â€¢	**Excel** - Data processing and Dashboard Creation

## Data Cleaning/ Processing
The dataset is already cleaned an ready to use. I have created new columns of "good_vs_bad_loan" based on "loan_status" column.


## Problem Statement
1.  What are the total and Month-to-Date (MTD) loan applications and their trends Month-over-Month (MoM)?
2.  What are the total, MTD, and MoM changes in the amount of funds disbursed and received?
3.  What are the average interest rates and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios overall, MTD, and MoM?
4.  What percentage of loans are classified as 'Good' versus 'Bad'?
5.  How do loan metrics vary by state, loan term, employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership status?

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the financial loan data to answer the key questions mentioned above, such as trends in loan applications, funding amounts, interest rates, and DTI ratios over time.

## Analysis
### 1.  Summary Dashboard
![](SummaryDashboard.png)
1. The total number of loan applications stands at 38.6K, of which 33.2K are classified as good loans and 5.3K as bad loans. This indicates that a majority of the loans fall under the good loan category, reflecting positive performance.
2. The total funded amount across all loans is $435.8M, with $370.2M of that total funding good loans and $65.5M allocated to bad loans.
3. The total amount received from these loans is $473.1M, with $435.8M from good loans and $37.3M from bad loans, suggesting that good loans contribute significantly to the revenue stream.
4. The average interest rate across all loans is 12.05%, showing consistency in the pricing of loans, while the average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is 13.33%, indicating the general financial standing of borrowers.


### 2.  Overview Dashboard
![](OverviewDashboard.png)
1. **Steady Increase**: Loan applications increased from 2.3K in January to 4.3K in December.
2. **Top-Performing State**: California (CA) leads in loan applications.
3. **Loan Purpose**: Debt consolidation accounts for 18.2K applications, the most common reason.

### 3.  Month-to-Date Dashboard
![](MTD.png)
1. In the month of December, there were 4.3K loan applications, reflecting the highest monthly application volume for the year.
2. The MTD total funded amount in December was $54.0M, indicating an upward trend in the allocation of funds to borrowers as the year progressed.
3. The MTD total amount received in December reached $58.1M, showing a substantial inflow of funds and successful loan repayments.
4. The MTD average interest rate for December was 12.36%, which is slightly higher than the yearly average, suggesting an uptick in interest rates during the last month of the year.
5. The MTD average DTI ratio rose to 13.67% in December, representing the highest DTI ratio of the year and indicating that borrowers' debt levels were at their peak during this time.

### 4.  Month-on-Month Dashboard
![](MoM.png)
1. Loan applications grew steadily over the year, with a noticeable increase in December compared to earlier months, illustrating a positive trend in loan demand.
2. The MoM total funded amount saw a significant 13.0% increase, suggesting that more funds were being allocated to borrowers as the year progressed, particularly in the latter months.
3. The MoM total amount received also experienced a 15.8% increase, reflecting improved loan repayment rates or higher loan amounts being collected.
4. The MoM average interest rate reached 12.36% in December, a higher rate compared to earlier months, potentially indicating tightening credit conditions or increased loan risk.
5. The MoM average DTI ratio also saw an increase, reaching 13.67% by the end of the year, pointing to a growing financial burden on borrowers, which may require careful monitoring moving forward.

## Findings
1. **High number of loan applications**: A total of **38.6K applications** were received, with **33.2K classified as good loans**.
2. **Increasing loan demand**: Steady growth from **2.3K in January** to **4.3K in December**.
3. **Top-performing state**: **California** leads in the highest number of applications.
4. **Debt consolidation** is the most common loan purpose, with 18.2K applications.
5. **Rising interest rates**: The **average interest rate** in December peaked at **12.36%**, higher than the yearly average.
6. **Increased Debt-to-Income (DTI)**: December saw the highest DTI at **13.67%**, indicating a growing financial burden on borrowers.

## Recommendation
1. **Monitor borrower risk**: Keep an eye on rising **DTI ratios** and **interest rates** to mitigate potential defaults.
2. **Focus on debt consolidation products**: Given the high demand, optimize and promote loans tailored for debt consolidation.
3. **State-level targeting**: Continue capitalizing on opportunities in high-performing states like **California** while exploring potential growth in underperforming regions.
4. **Review loan qualification criteria**: Given the rise in bad loans, consider adjusting risk criteria or tightening requirements for specific loan categories.


## Limitations
The dataset is based on a simulated environment and may not reflect real-world dynamics. The analysis is for demonstration purposes.
