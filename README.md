# Bank Loan Report Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Bank Loan Report Project repository! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of our bank's lending activities, helping us monitor, assess, and optimize our loan portfolio. By utilizing various dashboards and visualizations, this project aims to deliver actionable insights into key loan metrics, loan performance, and overall portfolio health.

**_Disclaimer_** : _All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institutiion or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate capabilities of Microsoft Excel._

## Data Sources
Financial Loan Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "financial_loan.csv" file, containing detailed information about each loan issued by the company.

## Tools
â€¢	Excel - Data processing and Dashboard Creation

## Data Cleaning/ Processing
The dataset is already cleaned an ready to use. I have created new columns of "good_vs_bad_loan" based on "loan_status" column.


## Problem Statement
1.  What are the total and Month-to-Date (MTD) loan applications and their trends Month-over-Month (MoM)?
2.  What are the total, MTD, and MoM changes in the amount of funds disbursed and received?
3.  What are the average interest rates and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios overall, MTD, and MoM?
4.  What percentage of loans are classified as 'Good' versus 'Bad'?
5.  How do loan metrics vary by state, loan term, employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership status?

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
1.  What are the total and Month-to-Date (MTD) loan applications and their trends Month-over-Month (MoM)?
2.  What are the total, MTD, and MoM changes in the amount of funds disbursed and received?
3.  What are the average interest rates and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios overall, MTD, and MoM?
and so on.
